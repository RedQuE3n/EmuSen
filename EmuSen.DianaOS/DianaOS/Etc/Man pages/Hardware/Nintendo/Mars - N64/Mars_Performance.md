# Mars — performance: the profile, and what each change bought

*Phase G, opened 2026-09-18. The probe is `EmuSen.WiseMan/Cores/MarsPerformanceProbeTests.cs`; the profile was taken
with `dotnet-trace` against a scratch harness outside the repository. The phase's brief is `Mars_Gameplan.md` §4.7:
"opens with a profile, not a plan".*

## 0. The rule this phase works under

**Every change must leave Mars's output bit for bit as it was.** Everything Phases A to F built was graded on exact
output — the corpus's verdicts, angrylion's pixels, the replays of `Mars_SaveStates.md` — and a faster Mars that draws
one pixel differently has thrown that grading away. So each change here is measured twice: for speed, and against a
recorded baseline of the three games' output (§1), frame by frame.

## 1. The probe

`MarsPerformanceProbeTests`, off unless `EMUSEN_MARS_PERF` names a directory, runs every game in the test folder for
600 frames through the bundle a frontend loads — debug target attached, the picture presented every frame — in a
data-store folder of its own, so no save from an earlier run changes the boot. It times `RunFrame` alone, and after
each frame hashes the presented picture, all of RDRAM and the audio drained, beside the cycle count.

- **With `EMUSEN_MARS_PERF_RECORD=1`** it writes those hashes as the baseline, one file a game, in
  `~/.cache/emusen/mars-golden/`. They are derived from commercial games and stay out of the repository.
- **Otherwise it compares**, and fails on the first frame whose picture, memory, audio or cycle count differs,
  naming it.

**It reproduces.** Recorded and then compared with no change between, all 600 frames of all three games matched,
and the times agreed within one per cent:

| | first run | second run | frame budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ocarina of Time (Europe) | 7.30 fps, 137.0 ms | 7.33 fps, 136.5 ms | 20 ms (PAL) |
| Super Mario 64 (Europe) | 9.64 fps, 103.7 ms | 9.57 fps, 104.5 ms | 20 ms (PAL) |
| Wave Race 64 (USA) | 14.71 fps, 68.0 ms | 14.68 fps, 68.1 ms | 16.7 ms (NTSC) |

That is 15, 19 and 25 per cent of the console's speed, in a Release build on this workstation, from a cold boot
through each game's title or attract mode.

## 2. The profile

**Method.** `dotnet-trace collect --profile dotnet-sampled-thread-time`, which samples each managed thread's stack at
about 100 Hz, over the same 600 frames of each game, in Release, through a frontend's bundle. The RSP and the RDP run
*inside* the processor's bus ticks, so a flat per-method count would bill their work to whatever instruction was
executing; instead each sample is charged to the **deepest Mars component on its stack** — the RSP if `Rsp.Step` is
on it, else the RDP, else the video interface, else the processor and its bus.

| share of the emulation thread | VI | CPU and bus | RDP | RSP | the core's loop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Super Mario 64 | **53.0%** | 35.7% | 4.0% | 3.6% | 3.7% |
| Wave Race 64 | 33.6% | **47.9%** | 7.5% | 6.6% | 4.3% |
| Ocarina of Time | **61.6%** | 28.6% | 5.9% | 1.7% | 2.1% |

**The plan asked whether the interpreter or the RDP is the wall** (`Mars_Gameplan.md` §2.2). ~~"The first question it
asks is whether the interpreter or the RDP is the wall."~~ **It is neither: it is the video interface's scan-out.**
Turning RDRAM into the displayed picture — the 640-column walk with its anti-aliasing, dither and divot filters,
which a frontend asks for every frame — is the largest single cost in two of the three games, and `Vi.Walk` and
`Vi.Dither` alone take 30 to 61 per cent of the thread. The interpreter is second. The RDP and the RSP together are
under 15 per cent in every game.

**What that says about the plan's levers.** A recompiler answers only the processor's share: a third to a half of the
time in these scenes, so even an infinitely fast CPU would leave Mars at under twice its speed. HLE graphics, a GPU
rasterizer and microcode HLE — the levers `Mars_Gameplan.md` §2.1 deferred — answer shares of 4 to 14 per cent.

**What it is not evidence for.** These are boots, title screens and an attract race: 3D scenes with more geometry would
move work towards the RSP and the RDP, and nothing here says how far. 100 Hz sampling over about a minute a game
resolves shares of a per cent or so, not below. And "CPU and bus" includes whatever the JIT inlined into `Cpu.Step` —
device ticks, bus reads, the timer — so its exclusive share is not the interpreter's dispatch alone.

## 3. The VI's samples, once a row

**What was slow.** With resampling on, every output pixel mixes four samples — the pixel a step lands on, the next one,
and the two below — and every sample is the source pixel fetched and filtered: the dither filter reads eight
neighbours, the anti-aliasing filter six, and divot, when on, samples each neighbour across the row as well. The
picture is 640 columns wide and most frame buffers are 320, so each step lands on a source pixel twice, and each
source pixel was filtered about eight times a row — once for each output pixel that reached it, from either side.

**The change.** `Vi.Remembered` keeps each row's samples by their offset from the row's first step, for the row being
read and the row below it, and a stamp per row retires them without clearing anything. The first request makes the
sample; later ones in the same row take it. A sample is a function of RDRAM, its hidden bits, the video registers and
its own arguments, and a scan changes none of them — it writes only the raster — so the first answer is the answer.
The cache is presentation scratch, marked out of the save state, which keeps the state's layout as it was.

**What it bought**, from the probe, with every frame of all three games identical to the baseline:

| | before | after | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ocarina of Time | 7.33 fps | 13.32 fps | 1.82× |
| Super Mario 64 | 9.57 fps | 15.48 fps | 1.62× |
| Wave Race 64 | 14.68 fps | 19.30 fps | 1.31× |

**And what the profile says now:**

| share of the emulation thread | VI | CPU and bus | RDP | RSP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Super Mario 64 | 23.4% (was 53.0%) | 58.1% | 6.7% | 5.5% |
| Wave Race 64 | 13.3% (was 33.6%) | 62.4% | 10.0% | 8.2% |
| Ocarina of Time | 31.5% (was 61.6%) | 49.3% | 11.2% | 3.6% |

The processor is now the largest share in every game. What remains of the VI is mostly the walk's own per-pixel work —
three mixes, gamma, four stores — and the samples of a source row that two output rows share, which this change
still makes twice, once for each row.
