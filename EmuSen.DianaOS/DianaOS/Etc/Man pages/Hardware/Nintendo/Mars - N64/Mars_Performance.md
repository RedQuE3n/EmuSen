# Mars — performance: the profile, and what each change bought

*Phase G, opened 2026-09-18. The probe is `EmuSen.WiseMan/Cores/MarsPerformanceProbeTests.cs`; the profile was taken
with `dotnet-trace` against a scratch harness outside the repository. The phase's brief is `Mars_Gameplan.md` §4.7:
"opens with a profile, not a plan".*

## 0. The rule this phase works under

**Every change must leave Mars's output bit for bit as it was.** Everything Phases A to F built was graded on exact
output — the corpus's verdicts, angrylion's pixels, the replays of `Mars_SaveStates.md` — and a faster Mars that draws
one pixel differently has thrown that grading away. So each change here is measured twice: for speed, and against a
recorded baseline of the three games' output (§1), frame by frame.

## 1. The probe

`MarsPerformanceProbeTests`, off unless `EMUSEN_MARS_PERF` names a directory, runs every game in the test folder for
600 frames through the bundle a frontend loads — debug target attached, the picture presented every frame — in a
data-store folder of its own, so no save from an earlier run changes the boot. It times `RunFrame` alone, and after
each frame hashes the presented picture, all of RDRAM and the audio drained, beside the cycle count.

- **With `EMUSEN_MARS_PERF_RECORD=1`** it writes those hashes as the baseline, one file a game, in
  `~/.cache/emusen/mars-golden/`. They are derived from commercial games and stay out of the repository.
- **Otherwise it compares**, and fails on the first frame whose picture, memory, audio or cycle count differs,
  naming it.

**It reproduces.** Recorded and then compared with no change between, all 600 frames of all three games matched,
and the times agreed within one per cent:

| | first run | second run | frame budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ocarina of Time (Europe) | 7.30 fps, 137.0 ms | 7.33 fps, 136.5 ms | 20 ms (PAL) |
| Super Mario 64 (Europe) | 9.64 fps, 103.7 ms | 9.57 fps, 104.5 ms | 20 ms (PAL) |
| Wave Race 64 (USA) | 14.71 fps, 68.0 ms | 14.68 fps, 68.1 ms | 16.7 ms (NTSC) |

That is 15, 19 and 25 per cent of the console's speed, in a Release build on this workstation, from a cold boot
through each game's title or attract mode.

## 2. The profile

**Method.** `dotnet-trace collect --profile dotnet-sampled-thread-time`, which samples each managed thread's stack at
about 100 Hz, over the same 600 frames of each game, in Release, through a frontend's bundle. The RSP and the RDP run
*inside* the processor's bus ticks, so a flat per-method count would bill their work to whatever instruction was
executing; instead each sample is charged to the **deepest Mars component on its stack** — the RSP if `Rsp.Step` is
on it, else the RDP, else the video interface, else the processor and its bus.

| share of the emulation thread | VI | CPU and bus | RDP | RSP | the core's loop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Super Mario 64 | **53.0%** | 35.7% | 4.0% | 3.6% | 3.7% |
| Wave Race 64 | 33.6% | **47.9%** | 7.5% | 6.6% | 4.3% |
| Ocarina of Time | **61.6%** | 28.6% | 5.9% | 1.7% | 2.1% |

**The plan asked whether the interpreter or the RDP is the wall** (`Mars_Gameplan.md` §2.2). ~~"The first question it
asks is whether the interpreter or the RDP is the wall."~~ **It is neither: it is the video interface's scan-out.**
Turning RDRAM into the displayed picture — the 640-column walk with its anti-aliasing, dither and divot filters,
which a frontend asks for every frame — is the largest single cost in two of the three games, and `Vi.Walk` and
`Vi.Dither` alone take 30 to 61 per cent of the thread. The interpreter is second. The RDP and the RSP together are
under 15 per cent in every game.

**What that says about the plan's levers.** A recompiler answers only the processor's share: a third to a half of the
time in these scenes, so even an infinitely fast CPU would leave Mars at under twice its speed. HLE graphics, a GPU
rasterizer and microcode HLE — the levers `Mars_Gameplan.md` §2.1 deferred — answer shares of 4 to 14 per cent.

**What it is not evidence for.** These are boots, title screens and an attract race: 3D scenes with more geometry would
move work towards the RSP and the RDP, and nothing here says how far. 100 Hz sampling over about a minute a game
resolves shares of a per cent or so, not below. And "CPU and bus" includes whatever the JIT inlined into `Cpu.Step` —
device ticks, bus reads, the timer — so its exclusive share is not the interpreter's dispatch alone.
